For example, if you search for coffee shops, you’re likely searching for coffee shops near you. Your location helps to show you nearby results, even if you didn't include a location in your search.
Your location comes from a variety of sources, which are used together to estimate where you are. You can update your location settings as you use Google services to get the search results you want and control your privacy in a way that's right for you.
If you want to learn more about how location works before changing your settings, below you’ll find info on how Google determines location when you search.

Update your location to get better local results
If you’re searching for something nearby and not finding local search results, try these fixes:

Add your current location to your search, like coffee shops in Chelsea.
Check that your device sends location to Google when you search. Follow the steps below to manage your device location settings.

You can help Google give you better results from your home or work when you set:

Your home address
Your work address


Manage your device location settings
Phones and tablets can send location information to apps and websites if your device location setting is turned on, and your app and browser permissions allow it. You can control whether location is sent from your device to any app or website, including google.com, by changing your location permissions.
Important: Before you manage your app or browser permissions, check that your device location is turned on for your phone or tablet. Learn how to manage your Android device’s location settings.
Manage location permissions
 For a website, like google.com

When you visit a website in a web browser, like Chrome, you can turn location permissions on or off separately for the browser itself, and for websites that request your location, like google.com.
If you want a website like google.com to have access to your device location, turn location permission on for both your browser and the website.

Turn location permission on or off for your browser
You can control if your browser is able to use location at all.

On your Android device, open the Settings app .
Tap Location  App permission.
Tap on your browser app, like Chrome.
Choose location access for the browser app: Allow or Deny.


Important: Some of these steps only work on Android 10 and up. Learn how to control your app permissions, including location for earlier versions of Android.
Turn location permission on or off for a website
If your browser can use location, you can control if your browser sends location to specific websites, like google.com.

On your Android phone or tablet, open your browser and go to google.com.
To the left of the address bar, tap Lock   Permissions.
Turn Location on or off for google.com.


Learn more about changing site permissions in Chrome.
Important: It can sometimes take a long time for your browser to get your current device location. To give you search results quickly, google.com might use your device's location from the last time you used Google. This location is stored in a cookie set to expire after 6 hours. Learn more about managing cookies. 

 For an app, like the Google app


​​If you’re searching using an app, like the Google app or Google Maps, you can control whether location is available to the app using your phone or tablet’s location permissions.


On your Android device, open the Settings app .
Tap Location  App permission.
Tap the app you use to search, like the Google app  or Google Maps .
Choose location access for this app: Allow or Deny.


Important: Some of these steps only work on Android 10 and up. Learn how to control your app permissions, including location for earlier versions of Android.





How Google determines your location when you search
When you use Google, like with Maps, Search or Google Assistant, your current location is estimated from several sources, depending on their availability.

Important: Most of these sources of location can be controlled using either your device's permissions, your account preferences, or other settings. Learn more below about how your choices affect your privacy and location.
Sources for determining location when you search
When you use Google, you can find out how your location was estimated at the bottom of the results page.
Your device location

Many devices, like phones or computers, can work out their precise location. This kind of precise location is useful in apps, like Google Maps to give directions or help you get useful nearby search results. For example, some searches that rely more on precisely where you are, like coffee shop, bus stop or atm, will usually give more helpful results with location permissions turned on.
Following the steps above, you can manage your device-based location settings to choose if location is available when you search. Depending on your device, you can usually turn location on or off for individual apps & websites and for your device itself.
If you're using a Smart Home device, like a Nest Audio or Nest Hub, you can set the device's location in the Google Home app.
If your device location was used to help get your search results, the location information at the bottom of the search results page will say From your device.

Important: It can sometimes take a long time for your browser to get your current device location. To give you search results quickly, google.com might use your device's location from the last time you used Google. This location is stored in a cookie set to expire after 6 hours. Learn more about managing cookies. 

Your home or work address, from your Google Account

If you set your home or work addresses, they may be used to estimate your location when it’s likely that you’re at one of these places.
You can edit homeand workaddresses in your Google account.
If the location of your home or work was used to help get your search results, the location information at the bottom of the search results page will say Based on your places (Home) or (Work).


Your previous activity on Google sites & apps

If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your Google Account. Some items from your activity may include the general area you were in at the time. A precise location can be stored in your activity if your activity involves a precise location.
In some cases, areas that you have searched for in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search. For example, if you search for coffee shops in Chelsea and then nail salon, Google might show nail salons in Chelsea.
You can view and control your Web & App Activity, at myactivity.google.com. Learn how to view & control activity on your account.
If you’re not signed in to your Google Account, Google may store some location information for previous searches from the device you’re using to help provide more relevant results and recommendations. If you turn off Search customization , Google won't use previous searches to estimate your location. Learn more about how to search and browse in Incognito mode.
If your previous activity was used to help get your search results, the location information at the bottom of the search results page will say "Based on your past activity."


The IP address of your Internet connection

An IP address, also called Internet address, is assigned to your device by your Internet Service Provider. It's a requirement to use the internet. IP addresses are used to make the connection between your device and the websites and services you use.
IP addresses are roughly based on geography. This means that any website you use, including google.com, may get some information about your general area.
If your IP address was used to estimate your current general area for your search, the location information at the bottom of the search results page will say From your internet address.

Important: The Internet doesn't work without IP addresses. When you use sites, apps, or services like Google, they can usually detect some information about your location.


Location controls & your privacy
When you search on Google, Google will always estimate the general area that you’re searching from. Estimating the general area that you’re in means that Google can give you relevant results, and keep your account safe by detecting unusual activity, such as signing in from a new city.
A general area is larger than 1 sq mi, and has at least 1000 users so that the general area of your search does not identify you, helping to protect your privacy. This means that a general area is typically much larger than 1 sq mi outside of cities. The estimated general area comes from the location sources described in this article.
If you grant location permissions to google.com or Google apps on your device, then when you search, your precise location will be used by Google to show you the best search results. Precise location means exactly where you are, such as a particular address.
If you set your home or work addresses, and Google estimates that you’re at home or work, then the exact address will be used for your search.
