These newer versions are a step backwards for Hi-Translate. My complaints are several. I've tried updating the app over the years with little success. There needs to be a simple function where like the original version you drop the ball on the text and it would read the whole text regardless of the size. Where you would only set the permission once in settings not each translation session. Hi Translate morphed into something complicated.3,246 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoHumphrey Omizegbamore_vert Flag inappropriateMay 6, 2022This app is truly great. The translation is wonderful and makes for easy work. If there was a ten star, I joyfully would have given it to you. The only problem is that it depends highly on the use of data. I sincerely wish that it's offline capability will work just fine so that someone is not hindered when out of data. Thanks for this great app. Kudos!7,063 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoEyebiokin Damilolamore_vert Flag inappropriateShow review historyAugust 14, 2022I don't know what to do again, this app is giving me problem. It fails to translate always asking for accessibility even when the app is switch on in accessibility settings. I downloaded offline translate of Chinese, it's still not working. Giving network unavailable when the browsing network is good. I updated yesterday, it's still the same problem. I can't proceed the operation. I'm not happy. It ball disappears easily while using it. No clipboard translate in the settings.1,548 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoAI TranslateAugust 22, 2022Dear customer , Got it we will fix it soon
